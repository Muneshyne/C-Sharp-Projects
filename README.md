### Car Insurance 
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Twenty One (Blackjack)
This is the classic casino game Twenty One. Programmed to feel like you are at the table. First by sharing your name and how much $$$ you brought with you. Made with multiple classes and able to expand to more popular games later on. (Does not take IRL Money)
